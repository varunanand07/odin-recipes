    <p>
        When <strong>John Chandler</strong> submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become.
     </p>

     <p>
        One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.

        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Method:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
