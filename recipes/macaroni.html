        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>50g baguette, cut into small chunks</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter, plus 1 tbsp melted</li>
            <li>350g spiral or other short pasta</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp English mustard powder</li>
            <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>500ml whole milk</li>
            <li>250g vegetarian mature cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spread the baguette chunks over a <a href = "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/kimberley-wilsons-top-5-baking-trays" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">baking sheet</a>, drizzle with the melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack, then drain. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and English mustard powder, cook for 1 min, then stir in the plain flour.</li>
            <li>Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a lump-free sauce. Simmer for 5 mins, whisking all the time until thickened. Take off the heat, then stir in the cheddar and half the parmesan.</li>
            <li>Stir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce. Tip into a large ovenproof dish, or four individual dishes.</li>
            <li>Scatter over the bread and the remaining parmesan, then bake for 20 mins until crisp and golden. Can be frozen before baking – defrost thoroughly before cooking.</li>
        </ol>
